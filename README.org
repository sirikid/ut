#+title: UT
#+author: Ivan Sokolov

UT is a URI templating engine, implementation of [[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6570][RFC 6570]], written in
pure Erlang.

* Features

+ Full RFC support and handy extensions

+ Default values for missing variables

+ Require all or specific variables for expansion

+ Variables as binary strings or atoms

* Alternatives

+ uri_string :: Part of standard library, should be enough for simple
  cases like encoding query or quoting segment of the path.

+ cow_uri_template :: A straightforward implementation without any
  extensions, part of [[https://hex.pm/packages/cowlib][cowlib]].

+ [[https://hex.pm/packages/yuri_template][YuriTemplate]] :: My previous implementation.  After rework I decided
  to release improved version as a new library instead of bumping
  major version.

+ [[https://hex.pm/packages/uri_template][UriTemplate]] :: Silently ignores template errors.
